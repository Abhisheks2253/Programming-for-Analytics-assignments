# Travelling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing

### The first function solveTSP_SA accepts 3 inputs: 
### nodesDF: A VeRoViz nodes dataframe containing n locations, numbered 1 to n. Location 1 is assumed as the home location.
#### VeRoViz is an open-source project from the Optimator Lab, in the University at Buffalo's Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering
#### The aim of VeRoViz is to help such a user to obtain road network data, sketch the locations of nodes (e.g., customers and depots), visualize arcs (connections) among these nodes,
#### generate 3D movies showcasing solutions to vehicle routing problems, quickly generate test problems and distance (and/or time) matrices.
